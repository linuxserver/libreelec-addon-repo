    <description>
The Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

IMPORTANT: This addon will install an older version of pi-hole and will not update due to upstream changes that made maintenance very difficult. 

On initial install, enter an admin password. Port 53 must be open.
By default only IPv4 is enabled. IPv6 can be enabled in addon settings.
Server LAN IPs are autodetected, but can be overridden by manual entry in addon settings.
DNS servers can be changed in the webgui, however, if any of the addon settings are changed, DNS servers will reset to whatever is selected in addon settings or the default Google servers

This is a docker addon brought to you by the LinuxServer.io team.
